#For this project I used a sample database with mutiple tables located at https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/

#1.How many invoices are associated with each sales rep?
Select emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, count(inv.InvoiceId) as LifeTimeSold
from chinook.employees emp
join chinook.customers cust
on emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
join chinook.invoices inv
on cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
group by emp.EmployeeId;

#2.How much money has each sales rep made in total?
Select emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, SUM(inv.Total) as LifeTimeRevenue
from chinook.employees emp
join chinook.customers cust
on emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
join chinook.invoices inv
on cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
group by emp.EmployeeId;

#3.Which albums did each customer purchased tracks from? Keep everything in one row for each customer.
select FirstName,LastName,
GROUP_CONCAT(Title, ', ') AS PurchasedAlbums
from (
select cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, alb.Title
from chinook.customers cust
left join chinook.invoices inv 
    ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
inner join chinook.invoice_items initem 
    ON inv.InvoiceId = initem.InvoiceId
left join chinook.tracks track 
    ON initem.TrackId = track.TrackId
right join chinook.albums alb 
    ON track.AlbumId = alb.AlbumId
where cust.FirstName != "NULL"
group by cust.CustomerId, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, alb.Title
) AS subquery
group by FirstName, LastName;

#4.How many items did each customer purchased, how many transactions did they have and what was the total spent for it all?
select cust.FirstName,cust.LastName,(
        select SUM(ii.Quantity)
        from chinook.invoices inv
        join chinook.invoice_items ii 
        on inv.InvoiceId = ii.InvoiceId
        where cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
    ) AS TotalQuantityPurchased,
COUNT(DISTINCT inv.InvoiceId) AS NumberOfInvoices, SUM(inv.Total) AS TotalAmountSpent
from chinook.customers cust
join chinook.invoices inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
group by cust.CustomerId;

#5.Which sales agent is associated with each invoice?
Select emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceId
from chinook.employees emp
join chinook.customers cust
on emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportrepId
join chinook.invoices inv
on cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
order by emp.LastName;

#6.What were the total sales for 2009?
select SUM(Total) as TotalSales_2009
from chinook.invoices
where InvoiceDate like '2009%';
